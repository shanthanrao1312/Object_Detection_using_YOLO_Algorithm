# 🚗✨ Diagnosis of Objects for Driverless Vehicles Using YOLO Algorithm ✨🚗

Welcome to the forefront of autonomous navigation! This project harnesses the power of **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**, a revolutionary real-time object detection algorithm that redefines how driverless vehicles perceive and respond to their environment.

YOLO’s unique ability to process an entire image in one pass, dividing it into regions and predicting bounding boxes with probabilities, ensures **speed and accuracy**. It’s the ultimate game-changer for detecting obstacles, pedestrians, traffic signs, and more—making every journey safer and smarter.
